// An executible to validate CW's Unit Mappers to Attila's db files. //

# Workflow
1. Use PFM/RPFM to export the land_unit db's from Attila as .tsv, and place in the "attila_exports" folder. 
You will need to rename the .tsv's to ensure you don't overwrite it when you repeat it for each of the Attila sources for unit keys.
